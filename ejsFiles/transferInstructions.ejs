                        In the case of all systems on this list, recreating the Mii from scratch will functionally work, with the exception of Amiibo which do have to be transferred at least somewhere first (some DS games only supported importing from a Wii, but these are obscure and unlikely to be referenced). All Miis on this website should be able to generate instructions for every official Mii creator tool still available. The purposes of this guide will be to transfer Miis off of one of those systems to upload here, and to transfer to those systems. Recreation is an assumed possibility in all cases but Amiibo.<br><br>
                        Unofficial Mii Makers will not be listed here. External programs to assist in loading the Miis to and from the console may be mentioned, but should not require modding the console for the scope of this guide.

                        Miis on the DS are extremely limited. Only a few games support them, most of which are Japan exclusive. The main Mii game on DS is <em>Tomodachi Collection</em>, which only released in Japan.<br><br>
                        The only known method of transferring Miis to a DS (or DSi) is from a Wii via its Mii Channel's initially hidden "Connect to DS" feature. To my knowledge, there is <b>no supported way to export a Mii from a DS</b> to a Wii or anywhere else, aside from recreating the Mii manually.

                        In Tomodachi Collection, you can import Miis from the Wii via the option in Town Hall after you have made at least three Mii residents on the island. In every other game, the option will be found shortly after entering the game or in Final Fantasy's case unlocking the item that allows this transfer to be done. You will be looking for an option to Import from Wii.

                        Transferring Miis to and from the Wii is, to me, one of the most thematically fun as the vehicle for doing so will be the Wiimote.<br><br>
                        To start, open the Wii's Mii Channel. You will be looking for the Wiimote icon in the top right. After clicking it, select the connected Wiimote you would like to take Miis on and off from. Here you have ten slots where you can rearrange Miis. If your goal was to take Miis to the system, this is where you will do so. To take Miis from the system, go ahead and place any Miis into the Wiimote slots, making sure to remember which slot from left to right the Mii was placed in, save, and then power off your Wii.<br><br>
                        I will likely research and see how difficult it would be to make my own program to streamline this process, but for now this is what it looks like.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You will need to pair your Wiimote to your Windows device. This can with some models be done simply through bluetooth settings and putting the Wiimote in sync mode, but the most consistent method I've found is simply to pair the Wiimote in <a target="_blank" href="https://dolphin-emu.org/">Dolphin</a>, and once it is paired, leave Dolphin running but we won't be using it further.<br><br>
                        You can then use <a target="_blank" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/wdml/">WDML Mii Transfer</a>. After unzipping the program, with the Wiimote paired, you can use readslotX.bat to transfer a Mii off of the Wiimote and to your device, where X is the slot the Mii you wanted to read was in, minus one (so if the slot was the third from the left, use readslot2.bat). To write a Mii to the Wiimote, first place the Mii file in the same folder as the WDML files. Rename the file miiX.bat, where X is the slot you want to write the Mii to, minus one (so if I wanted to write to the fifth from the left, I would name it mii4.mii). You can then run writeslotX.bat, where X is the same number from miiX.bat.

                        If you have a 3DS, and you're just looking to transfer off of the Wii, the recommended option would be to transfer to your 3DS and use that as your way of getting it off of the console. First open the Wii's Mii Channel. If you don't see the DS icon on the right side of the screen, press and release <b>A</b>, then press and release <b>B</b>, then press and release <b>1</b>, and then press and hold <b>2</b>. After you do this, the DS icon should appear and you can press it. On the 3DS, open Mii Maker, then select "Send and Receive". Tap "Receive from Wii" and follow the prompts on both consoles. You should be able to freely send Miis to the 3DS from here, but not to the Wii. To write to the Wii, you will still have to use the method with a Windows device for now.

                        The 3DS is the easiest console to work with when it comes to transferring Miis. It can get Miis from the Wii (see the <a href="#wii">Wii</a> section), uses QR codes, can upload straight from its web browser, can scan QR codes easily, can write to Amiibos if you have the NFC Reader accessory OR a "New" 3DS (<b>required</b> for directly transferring to and from the Switch/2), and is compatible with Special Miis. The 3DS is, in my opinion, the best console for interacting with Miis.

The QR code will be displayed on screen and can be scanned by another device using <a href="/qr">this website</a>. You can also find the QR code file in the DCIM folder on your 3DS' SD card, or open this website in the 3DS Internet Browser and upload the image file from there.

                        To transfer a Mii between two Switch/2s, open the System Settings, then the Mii menu, and find the Send/Receive and "Search for Users to Connect With" options. Once both Switch/2s do this, you can connect them and transfer freely.

                        Mii Studio is Nintendo's online offering that exists primarily to provide profile pictures for your Nintendo account. After making sure your device is logged into <a href="https://accounts.nintendo.com/" target="_blank">https://accounts.nintendo.com/</a>, you can open Mii Studio <a href="https://my.nintendo.com/mii" target="_blank">here</a>.

                        To transfer Miis in and out of Mii Studio without direct recreation, you will need a tool of some kind. I will likely write my own at some point, but for the time being, <a href="https://mii.tools/studioloader/" target="_blank">this browser extension</a> by HEYimHeroic is able to help with this. After installing, go to <a href="https://my.nintendo.com/mii" target="_blank">Mii Studio</a>, edit a Mii, and make sure to make a small change even if you revert it right after. Once you do this, open the extension and the code for the Mii should be displayed. If you enter a code in the box, you can automatically import a Mii using the code. These codes can be found on Mii pages on this site, and can be used to upload as well.
