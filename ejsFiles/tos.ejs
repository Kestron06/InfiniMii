                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>InfiniMii is a website designed to provide an interface for working with Nintendo's Mii characters in as many capacities as possible. It is not necessary to modify your console or system in any way to interact with InfiniMii to the fullest, but it is designed to fully interface with and be an extension of and enhancement of these consoles, and in no way a replacement for them.</p>

                        However, you may not claim to represent InfiniMii or MiiJS in any way, unless a designated developer, moderator, or administrator by Kestron Programming.
