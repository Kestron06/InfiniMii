This is an incomplete website with the intent to have an upkept website in which you can upload and browse Mii characters, while also providing tools to work with Miis such as converting to and from the Wii/3DS/Wii U (the only way to get Miis on/off the Switch is Amiibos running through a Wii U/3DS), and instructions for recreating them on the Wii/3DS/Wii U/Switch.

Wii U and 3DS are interchangeable for most purposes, with the one exception being that the Wii U does not work with Special Miis.

You can take a look at pages.md or TODO.md to get an idea of the direction the site is going in
