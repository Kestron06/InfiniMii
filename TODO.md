# TODO
 - Add actual pages for error messages
 - Make Official Mii uploads feature games or other locations they were present, browse by game or location or console
 - Add Recreation Instructions for the Miis
 - Distinguish Uploaded and Published Miis
   - Able to upload Miis that are saved for you privately
      - Allow up to a certain number of these per user, things like family and friends you want saved between consoles without being public  
   - Published Miis
      - No cap on published Miis you can have, these are in the public space for everyone to see.
 - Add Mii Studio codes as download, upload, and conversion options.
    - Write converting from Studio to 3DS

## Events/Games
 - CheckMiiOut
   - Give a Character or Concept, they submit Miis to the contest. Mods pick a top three who all get their Miis promoted, users pick a top one to become Contest Winner displayed underneath Highlighted Mii until a new contest winner is selected

## Half-Baked Ideas
 - Have a separate section of the site for tracking Tomodachi Life travelers, activate the ability to track this by inputting island address (it's a virtual island address not a real one)
 - Mii'd Up
   - A knock-off of Champ'd Up from Jackbox, but making Miis instead of drawings
 - App
   - Make an app for Android and iOS to do everything the website does but have no cap on saved Miis that aren't published, focus more heavily on the saved but unpublished Miis in the app while still alloweing to publish and browse and everything else. More of a Mii swiss army knife than a social Miidia like the website would be.

## Other Notes
 - Ensure it works on the 3DS and Wii U Browsers so that you don't have to transfer QR Codes off of the 3DS to upload.
 - Hash the non-meta fields of the Mii during upload, if it exactly matches another upload, error out and let them know they can argue against in KP server or feedback email.
