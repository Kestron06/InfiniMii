# TODO
 - Add actual pages for error messages
 - Fix Upload Mii Mii Studio and Styling
 - Test ALL interactions
 - Proofread and Modify ENTITY-MAP
 - Hash the non-meta fields of the Mii during upload, if it exactly matches another upload, error out and let them know they can argue against in KP server or feedback email.
 - Turn all icons and emojis used as icons into a partials style format
 - Turn signup flow into the proper format
 - Mii format guide
 - API Docs?
 - Make the Like buttons work across the whole website
 - Add Supporters
    - Special category of Miis separate from the other categories, exclusively Miis from donators. 
    - Special icon next to their name across the whole website
    - Special role on their profile
    - In featured Miis section, a random supporter is chosen. From that random supporter's Miis, choose one to feature. This is so that having 100 Miis does not give you better chances of being featured than someone with 1.
    - Donation page links to Paypal (Add some other donation methods?) with nothing preset except who you're paying. They decide how much, they decide if its monthly or not. Nothing is set by default.
    - Link to Discord so supporting InfiniMii counts towards Donator/Supporter tiers in Discord
 - Fix Mod Tools and editing on Private Miis, and Private Mii Page CSS
 - Add paginations to miis.ejs and to userPage.ejs
 - Ensure it works on the 3DS and Wii U Browsers so that you don't have to transfer QR Codes off of the 3DS to upload.

## Events/Games
 - CheckMiiOut
   - Give a Character or Concept, they submit Miis to the contest. Mods pick a top three who all get their Miis promoted, users pick a top one to become Contest Winner displayed underneath Highlighted Mii until a new contest winner is selected

## Future/Half-Baked Ideas
 - Have a separate section of the site for tracking Tomodachi Life travelers, activate the ability to track this by inputting island address (it's a virtual island address not a real one)
 - Mii'd Up
   - A knock-off of Champ'd Up from Jackbox, but making Miis instead of drawings
 - App
   - Make an app for Android and iOS to do everything the website does but have no cap on saved Miis that aren't published, focus more heavily on the saved but unpublished Miis in the app while still alloweing to publish and browse and everything else. More of a Mii swiss army knife than a social Miidia like the website would be.
