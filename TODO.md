Notes
 - Favicon and Banner are placeholders
 - User Settings
 - User Profiles
 - Mii Pages
 - Streamline signup a bit
 - Make Mii of the Day icons update the Mii in the list and vice versa

Half-Baked Ideas
 - Have a separate section of the site for tracking Tomodachi Life travelers, activate the ability to track this by inputting island address (it's a virtual island address not a real one)
 - Make it work on the 3DS browser so you don't have to transfer QR codes off of the 3DS to use


 TODO:
