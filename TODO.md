   - Wii, through connecting the remote to another device
      - How hard would it be to make the website able to connect directly?
   - 3DS/Wii U, through QR Codes - uploading from the 3DS/Wii U, scanning from another device using the 3DS/Wii U
   - Switch/2 - Recreation, Amiibos using 3DS with Amiibo reader, New 3DS, or Wii U
   - DS - Recreation akin to a Wii
 - Distinguish Uploaded and Published Miis
   - Able to upload Miis that are saved for you privately
      - Allow up to a certain number of these per user, things like family and friends you want saved between consoles without being public  
   - Published Miis
      - No cap on published Miis you can have, these are in the public space for everyone to see.
 - Some basic notifications, like when banned or having a Mii deleted should be added. Probably as a popup, or bar at the top. A comment and DM system will not be built in, instead redirecting to Discord.

## Events/Games
 - CheckMiiOut
   - Give a Character or Concept, they submit Miis to the contest. Mods pick a top three who all get their Miis promoted, users pick a top one to become Contest Winner displayed underneath Highlighted Mii until a new contest winner is selected

## Half-Baked Ideas
 - Have a separate section of the site for tracking Tomodachi Life travelers, activate the ability to track this by inputting island address (it's a virtual island address not a real one)
 - Mii'd Up
   - A knock-off of Champ'd Up from Jackbox, but making Miis instead of drawings
 - App
   - Make an app for Android and iOS to do everything the website does but have no cap on saved Miis that aren't published, focus more heavily on the saved but unpublished Miis in the app while still alloweing to publish and browse and everything else. More of a Mii swiss army knife than a social Miidia like the website would be.

## Other Notes
 - Ensure it works on the 3DS and Wii U Browsers so that you don't have to transfer QR Codes off of the 3DS to upload.
 - Retheme to add a Mii Maker aesthetic?
 - Hash the non-meta fields of the Mii during upload, if it exactly matches another upload, error out and let them know they can argue against in KP server.
